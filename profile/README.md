## üëã Welcome!

Hi! I'm **Caribdis**, and I'm creating **Eternum**, a **choice-based visual novel** made in *Ren'Py*, packed with **romance, mystery, humor**, and so much more!

## üéÆ What is Eternum?

You're moving with your best friend to the city of **Kredon**, home to some of the best schools and universities in the country, to continue your studies.

However, in Kredon, there‚Äôs only one thing everyone talks about:

> **ETERNUM** ‚Äî the virtual, hyper-reality **MMORPG** released a few years ago that *revolutionized the world of technology*.

With a **neural implant** that recreates all five senses, it becomes impossible to distinguish between the game and the real world.

Thousands of servers form the network of Eternum:
- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Colorful, magic-filled fantasy worlds  
- üèôÔ∏è Foggy, sci-fi cities  
- üåå Any world you can imagine is within reach...

But beneath the surface of this digital paradise lies a **darker truth**:
- Black markets  
- Torture  
- Rape  
- Illegal content trafficking  
- Unlawful assemblies  
- Data theft  

**Eternum follows the rules of no man.**

Governments seem to turn a blind eye.  
Some say it‚Äôs due to addiction, others claim bribery, and a few believe... something else is going on.

> And you? What‚Äôs your role in this story?

Well... **That‚Äôs up to you now.**
